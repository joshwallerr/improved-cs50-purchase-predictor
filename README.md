# Improved CS50 Purchase Predictor

This is an enhanced implementation of the CS50 project, "Shopping".

## What's Different?

The main difference is that this code uses the Random Forest algorithm, instead of K-Nearest-Neighbours.

Although using Random Forest is extremely slow in comparison, the accuracy of the prediction is much greater.
